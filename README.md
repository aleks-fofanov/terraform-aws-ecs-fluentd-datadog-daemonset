Terraform module to provision ECS service configured to collect logs from containers scheduled on EC2 container
instances and ship them to Datadog.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

This module helps to provision Fluentd ECS service scheduled on every ECS container instances (EC2) as a daemon and
configured to ship logs to Datadog.

**Why this project**:
Installing Datadog agent on each node in your ECS cluster may not be an option for some users
as this can be expensive depending on the number of nodes in the cluster.

**Implementation notes and Warnings**:
- Don't forget to pass `Datadog API key` via env variables or secrets (recommended)
- Pefix your containers log tags with `docker.`, otherwise logs won't be processed, for example:
  ```json
  "logConfiguration": {
      "logDriver": "fluentd",
      "options": {
          "fluentd-address": "127.0.0.1:24224",
          "tag": "docker.backend-app"
      }
  }
  ```

This module is backed by best of breed terraform modules maintained by [Cloudposse](https://github.com/cloudposse).

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-fluentd-datadog-daemonset/releases).


This is a simple example of how to create an ECS cluster service scheduled with daemon scheduling strategy:

```hcl
module "fluentd_datadog_logs_aggregator" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-fluentd-datadog-daemonset?ref=master"
  name      = "fluentd"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"

  ecs_cluster_arn = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```




## Examples

### Full example
This example provisions:
- Fluentd ECS cluster log aggregator
- Cloudwatch log group for storing fluentd containers' logs
- Encrypted SSM Parameter for storing Datadog API key
- Additional policy that allows ECS agent access encrypted SSM parameter when creating fluentd containers
  and attaches it to fluentd service execution role
```hcl
module "fluentd_datadog_logs_aggregator" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-fluentd-datadog-daemonset?ref=master"
  name      = "fluentd"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"

  ecs_cluster_arn         = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
  task_cpu                = "256"
  task_memory             = "512"
  task_memory_reservation = "512"

  log_driver  = "awslogs"
  log_options = {
    "awslogs-region"        = "us-west-2"
    "awslogs-group"         = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.fluentd.name}"
    "awslogs-stream-prefix" = "fluentd"
  }

  secrets = [
    {
      name      = "DD_API_KEY",
      valueFrom = "${aws_ssm_parameter.datadog_api_key.arn}"
    }
  ]
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "fluentd" {
  statement {
    sid    = "SSMParameterStoreAccess"
    effect = "Allow"
    actions = [
      "ssm:GetParameters",
      "kms:Decrypt"
    ]
    resources = [
      "${data.aws_kms_key.aws_ssm.arn}",
      "${aws_ssm_parameter.datadog_api_key.arn}"
    ]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "fluentd_ecs_exec_role_additions" {
  name   = "fluentd"
  policy = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.fluentd.json}"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "fluentd_ecs_exec_role_additions" {
  role       = "${module.fluentd_datadog_logs_aggregator.task_exec_role_name}"
  policy_arn = "${aws_iam_policy.fluentd_ecs_exec_role_additions.arn}"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "fluentd" {
  name = "ECS/fluentd-daemonset"
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "datadog_api_key" {
  name        = "/some/path/DD_API_KEY"
  type        = "SecureString"
  value       = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
  overwrite   = "true"
  description = "Datadog API key"

  key_id = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
